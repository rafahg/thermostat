## THERMOSTAT WEEK CHALLENGE.

In this repositorie i will try to explain my proccess, step by step , to create
the termostat. It is going to be painful, but i hope, if some day, someone read this
, will enjoy as much as i did creating it. (If you see some grammar errors it is
  because i am from Spain, i fancy more Cervantes than Shakespeare, to be honest).

PD. Special thanks to George Swarbrick, who has teached me a few tricks and is a proper English Man and a Gentleman.

  ENJOY!..
